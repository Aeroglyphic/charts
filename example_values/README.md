# Example Value Files

This directory contains value files that are passed to `helm install` using the `-f` or `--values` flags for testing and demo purposes.


> __CAUTION__ You may find these examples useful when creating your own values files for use with F5 Network charts in your cluster, though these files __are not__ templates and __are not intended to be used in production__.
